## ⚠️ Project Status & Community

This integration is **actively developed** but I'm just getting started with Ajax security systems. I currently own and test with:
- ✅ **Hub 2 Plus**
- ✅ **MotionCam** (Motion detector with photo capture)
- ✅ **DoorProtect Plus** (Door/window contact sensor)
- ✅ **GlassProtect** (Glass break detector)
- ✅ **HomeSiren** (Indoor siren)

Users tested:
- ✅ **Superior Hub Hybrid 4G**
- ✅ **KeyPad TouchScreen Jeweller** (limited info available from API)
- ✅ **Superior DoorProtect Plus Jeweller**
- ✅ **FireProtect 2 RB (Heat/Smoke Jeweller)**
- ✅ **Superior HomeSiren Jeweller**
- ✅ **ReX 2 Jeweller**
- ✅ **StreetSiren Jeweller**
- ✅ **Superior MotionCam (PhOD) Jeweller**

Since I don't have access to all Ajax devices, **I cannot test every device type**.

**🤝 Community Help Needed**: If you own other Ajax devices and want to help test and improve this integration, your contributions would be greatly appreciated! Together we can make this the best Ajax integration for Home Assistant.

Issues, pull requests, and feedback are welcome!

## 📦 Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the 3 dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/foXaCe/ajax-security-hass`
6. Category: "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Search for "Ajax Security System"
9. Click "Download"
10. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Copy the `custom_components/ajax` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **"+ Add Integration"**
3. Search for **"Ajax Security System"**
4. Choose your connection mode:

#### Proxy Ajax (Recommended)
Connect via the Ajax community proxy server. Real-time events via SSE (Server-Sent Events).

- **Proxy URL**: URL of the Ajax proxy server
- **Email**: Your Ajax account email
- **Password**: Your Ajax account password

> **Note**: This is the recommended mode for most users. No API key required.

> ⚠️ **User accounts only**: This integration only supports **user accounts**. PRO/Enterprise accounts are not supported.

#### Direct Mode (Enterprise API key only)
Direct connection to the Ajax API. Requires an enterprise API key from Ajax Systems.

- **API Key**: Your enterprise API key from Ajax Systems
- **Email**: Your Ajax account email
- **Password**: Your Ajax account password
- **AWS Credentials** (optional): For real-time event notifications via SQS

> **Note**: Enterprise API keys are only available through Ajax Systems partnership program.

### Optional: Real-Time Events

#### SSE (Proxy Mode)
In proxy mode, real-time events are automatically received via Server-Sent Events (SSE). No additional configuration required.

#### AWS SQS (Direct Mode)
For instant updates (<1 second) in direct mode, configure AWS SQS credentials:
- **AWS Access Key ID**
- **AWS Secret Access Key**
- **Queue Name**

These credentials are provided by Ajax Systems with your enterprise API key.

#### Real-Time Event Limitations

Due to Ajax Systems architecture, **motion and door/window events are only sent in real-time when**:
- The system is **armed** (Away, Night, or Partial mode)
- OR the sensor has **"Always Active"** mode enabled

When the system is **disarmed** and sensors are not in "Always Active" mode:
- Motion and door events are **not** sent to SQS/SSE
- The integration falls back to polling (30 seconds)
- State changes are still detected, but with a delay

> 💡 **Tip**: Enable "Always Active" on motion sensors if you need real-time motion detection while disarmed (e.g., for automation). Note: This will use more battery and may trigger alarms if not configured properly (set siren to "sound only when armed").

### Options (after setup)

Go to the integration options to configure:
- **Persistent Notifications**: Show notifications in Home Assistant UI
- **Notification Filter**: Choose which notifications to display
- **Monitored Spaces**: Select which hubs/spaces to monitor

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your credentials are handled with the utmost care:**

### Credential Storage
- **Local storage only**: Credentials are stored in Home Assistant's encrypted config entry system
- **No third parties**: The integration communicates only with Ajax servers

### Authentication Process
1. **Password hashing**: Your password is hashed using SHA-256 before transmission
2. **Secure communication**: All API communication uses HTTPS (TLS/SSL)
3. **Session tokens**: Tokens are stored locally and refreshed automatically

### What the Developer Cannot Access
- ❌ I (the developer) **cannot access your credentials**
- ❌ No analytics, telemetry, or tracking
- ❌ No data collection of any kind
- ✅ Fully open source - you can audit the code yourself

## 📖 Usage

### Security Control

Use the **Alarm Control Panel** entity to control your security system:

```yaml
# Example automation: Arm when leaving home
automation:
  - alias: "Arm Ajax when leaving"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.your_name
        to: "not_home"
    action:
      - service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
        target:
          entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ajax_alarm_home
```

### Force Arming

Use force arming to arm the system even with open sensors:

```yaml
# Force arm (away)
service: ajax.force_arm
target:
  entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ajax_alarm_home

# Force arm night mode
service: ajax.force_arm_night
target:
  entity_id: alarm_control_panel.ajax_alarm_home
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Force arming ignores open sensors and system problems. Use with caution.

### Panic Button

```yaml
# Trigger emergency alarm
service: button.press
target:
  entity_id: button.ajax_panic_home
```

⚠️ **Warning**: The panic button triggers a **real emergency alarm**.

### Device Information Report

Generate a diagnostic report to help improve the integration:

```yaml
service: ajax.generate_device_info
```

This creates an anonymized JSON file with device information (no sensitive data included).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

The integration provides specific error messages to help diagnose login issues:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Invalid API key** | API key is missing or incorrect | Check your enterprise API key |
| **Invalid email or password** | Wrong credentials | Verify your Ajax account email and password |
| **Account type not supported** | Using a PRO/Enterprise account | Use a standard user account instead |

### Integration not loading
1. Check Home Assistant logs for errors
2. Verify your Ajax credentials are correct
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection
4. Make sure you're using a **user account** (not PRO/Enterprise)

### Real-time updates not working
1. Verify AWS SQS credentials are configured correctly
2. Check that the queue name matches exactly
3. Review logs for SQS connection errors

### Devices not appearing
1. Wait for initial sync to complete (up to 30 seconds)
2. Check that devices are visible in the Ajax app
3. Try reloading the integration

### Debug Logging

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ajax: debug
```
